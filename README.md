# Shell
This is a two part application. The first part consists of a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) where a user can enter commands. The second part consists of a [monte carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) where the amount of page faults in the applications are measured.

## Running the Application
* ### Linux
1. Install the application and open a terminal in the directory where the application is located.
2. Use the "make" command to compile the program. You can also compile both programs individually by using the "make ss" command for the simpleShell.c application and the "make mc" command for the monteCarlo.c application.
3. Use the "make clean" to remove a compilation of the program. You can also remove an programs individually by using the "make cleanss" command for the simpleShell.c application and the "make cleanmc" command for the monteCarlo.c application.
4. Use the "./ss" to run the simpleShell.c application and "./mc" to run the monteCarlo.c application. 

* ### Windows
1. To run the application on Windows install Cygwin or some alternative.
2. Install the application and open a terminal in the directory where the application is located.
2. Use the "make" command to compile the program. You can also compile both programs individually by using the "make ss" command for the simpleShell.c application and the "make mc" command for the monteCarlo.c application.
3. Use the "make clean" to remove a compilation of the program. You can also remove an programs individually by using the "make cleanss" command for the simpleShell.c application and the "make cleanmc" command for the monteCarlo.c application.
4. Use the "./ss" to run the simpleShell.c application and "./mc" to run the monteCarlo.c application.
